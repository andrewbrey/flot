## Features

Top feature: It's simple and works like a charm ❤️

- Adjustable transparency to ensure just the right level of visibility
- Stays on top of other windows and out of your way
- Optional "detached" mode which will let mouse clicks "pass through" Flōt to the window below
- Simple and clean design with just the cutest little logo drawn by my wife
